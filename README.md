## New Update

I have recently made significant improvements to my portfolio page to manage and display my achievements more efficiently. Initially, I deliberately chose not to use JavaScript in order to keep the page fast and accessible, especially for users on slower internet connections or older devices.

However, as my list of achievements grew, I found it increasingly challenging to maintain all the parts in the long HTML code. To overcome this limitation and enhance my experience while updating this page, I have now incorporated JavaScript into the portfolio page. I'm now utilizing a JSON file to store my achievements, and with the help of JavaScript, the webpage dynamically populates the achievements section using this JSON data.

This change allows me to keep the HTML lightweight and accessible while still showcasing all my accomplishments in an organized and user-friendly manner. The use of JavaScript has been carefully implemented to avoid unnecessary complexities and maintain the simplicity and accessibility of the portfolio page.

Feel free to check out the `data` folder in this repository to see how the achievements are structured. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to keep them to yourself! JK!

BTW! I have still kept the bootstrap JS commented out in the HTML file. I do not need it for now, but I might use it in the future to add some more features to the page. I have also kept the old HTML file in the repository for reference.

Happy browsing!
