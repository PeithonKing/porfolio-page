# Portfolio Page

Welcome to my portfolio page! This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio page. The portfolio page is hosted using GitHub Pages. You can view it at [https://peithonking.github.io/portfolio-page/](https://peithonking.github.io/portfolio-page/).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- ~~JavaScript~~

This portfolio page is designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind. I have deliberately chosen not to use JavaScript in order to keep the page fast and easy to load, even on slower internet connections or older devices. By focusing on the essentials and using only HTML and CSS, I have created a clean and lightweight portfolio page that showcases my work without any unnecessary distractions or complications.
