		"description": "I, with my friend, participated in this competition. We were given 6 problems and were supposed to solve one (or more) of them using our Machine Learning skills. We went with the Higgs Challenge. We were given a dataset of 11 million data points and were expected to predict the presence of Higgs boson. We used an ensemble model which consisted of 5 neural network architectures and an XGBoost architecture. We were able to achieve an area of 0.88 under the ROC Curve.",

Finally, I read a paper on a Quantum Robot and felt I could solve the problem addressed in the paper better. So I learned more about the topic and submitted my report on the same.",

		"description": "I did a course on the basics of Quantum Computation and Quantum Information jointly organized by <a href='http://www.iisertirupati.ac.in/'>IISER Tirupati</a> and Qkrishi. We learned the basic theory and had a hands-on experience with the IBM Quantum Experience. We also submitted a term project of Attacking Quantum Key Distribution Protocols. We demonstrated QKD algorithms like BB84 and E91 protocols in multiple devices on the same network using python libraries like Flask and Qiskit.",

		"description": "We built an autonomous drone with aid from RTC. The structure of the drone was built from scratch using aluminium box pipes, switchboard sunmica plates, and some small 3D-printed parts. We used pixhawk 4 as the flight controller. It can fly in both manual mode or follow a predefined path using GPS. This drone can be developed further for learning.",

I learned more about the different steps of doing NLP, their problems, and the different processes to solve them. I also learned about some scoring algorithms for sorting documents in a corpus concerning relevance to a query. Finally, I succeeded in bringing a MAP value of 0.21 for the AILA dataset provided to me (the maximum MAP value achieved before that was 0.14).",
